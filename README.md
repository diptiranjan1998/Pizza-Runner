# Pizza Runner

## Project Overview
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

## Data Description
Danny provided the date of his restaurant that contains 3 following tables:

1. **`Pizza_names:`** This table contains data about pizza_id and pizza_name.

2. **`pizza_recipes:`** This table contains data about pizza_id and toppings.

3. **`pizza_toppings:`** This table contains data about topping_id and topping_name.

4. **`runners:`** This table contains data about runner_id and registration_date.

5. **`customer_orders:`** This table contains data about order_id, customer_id, pizza_id, exclusions and extrasorder_time.

6. **`runner_orders:`** This table contains data about order_id, runner_id, pickup_time, distance_km, duration_minute and cancellation.
